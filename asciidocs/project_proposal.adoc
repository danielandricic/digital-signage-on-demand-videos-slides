== Project Client

As this project is part of an exercise, the project client is our school.

== Project Background

In our school, we have a huge Monitor in the auditorium. This monitor is mostly used for current news, weather service and to present new projects in the school.
To be able to show videos on this monitor quickly and easily, we would program an app
which streams the desired video to the monitor.
This would be used to show videos that represent or promote the school at the open day.

== Project Goals
===== Sense/purpose of the project

* Show videos for the open day.
* Possiblity for the students to show their projects on a large screen.

== **Functions of the App**

* Login for all Students and Teachers.
* Estimated time for the Available.
* Add Video to the waiting queue.
* Waiting Queue for all incoming Tasks.
* Calculate estimated waiting time.
* To offer the user an easy control to stream a video.
* Stream videos on other monitors.
* Manage the Permissions from the user.

== Stakeholders
* Teacher
* Student

== Shareholders

* School Administrator

== Final result
The result should be an app that is running, a connection
to the desired monitor (e.g. monitor in the auditorium)
and stream the desired video to the monitor.
